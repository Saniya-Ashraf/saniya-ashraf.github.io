This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
My name is Saniya Ashraf. I am currently an AI scientist at [Control Automotive and Robotics Lab](https://carl-buitems.github.io) at [Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.buitms.edu.pk). Our current Research Focuses on developing various Robots and state-of-the-art RL and Deep Learning Techniques. 
I have an Masters(thesis) in Computer Science from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/)
https://www.fsu.edu/. At FSU, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Xiuwen Liu] (https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~liux/).

My research interests are purely interdisciplinary. I believe to solve the crucial issues that our nation faces can be only addressed through the integration of insights, expertise and techniques from various research fields. I am a strong advocate of Women in STEM. 
I am a jack of all trades when it comes to hobbies. I love cooking, baking, reading, writing, knitting, sewing, embroidering, etc. But my main source of leisure is Art. I won several competitions in art including poster competition for WIE. My artwork [Am I human Enough]( https://hsf.fsu.edu/am-i-human-enough) received an Honorable mention in the Honors, scholars and fellows Visual Arts awards at Florida State University. I also enjoy gaming.
