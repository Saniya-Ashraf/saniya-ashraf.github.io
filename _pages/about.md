## ðŸŽ“ About Me
Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Saniya Ashraf, a Deep Learning Engineer and Lecturer by, well, also dayâ€”but a different part of the day. Juggling roles? Absolutely, and loving every bit of it!

## ðŸ›¡ Who Am I?
I'm an educator, a researcher, an engineer, an artist, a freelancer all rolled into one. My journey began at BUITEMS in Pakistan, where I majored in Software Engineering. Then, the Fulbright Scholarship whisked me away to Florida State University. There, I dipped my toes into Computer Vision and emerged with an MS in Computer Science. Not to brag, but I did make it to the Dean's list. Okay, maybe bragging a little.

What Gets Me Out of Bed?
In one wordâ€”possibilities. The thrill of what AI and Deep Learning can accomplish in realms as varied as healthcare and video gaming energizes me. Ever heard of using U-Nets and attention-guided techniques for neuroimaging? Yep, that's one of the projects I've worked on. The idea that code can literally "see" and "learn" fascinates me to no end.

### ðŸ§ª My Playground 

> ðŸŒŸ "Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning." - William Arthur Ward ðŸŒŸ

When I'm not delivering lectures or getting lost in code, I venture into fascinating domains of AI and ML. ðŸ¤–
When not at work or in the classroom, I'm engrossed in a myriad of research projects. When not in the lecture hall or deeply engrossed in coding, I'm usually exploring the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. My research has taken me from Applied ML/DL in real world problems. Whether you're fascinated by the intricate neural pathways of the human brain or the application of AI algorithms in unconventional fields, you're in the right place. I'm always excited about collaborative efforts, brainstorming new ideas, or engaging in a good academic debate, we should definitely talk.

### ðŸ’¡ Want To Know More?
I've also dabbled in non-academic pursuits. From receiving the Honorable Speaker award to serving as a Faculty Advisor for a Machine Learning Society, my goal is to have a footprint in as many sandboxes as possible. Did I mention I've also been learning Korean? Because, why not?

So, whether you're a student, a fellow researcher, or someone equally passionate about the transformative power of technology, let's connect. Who knows what marvels we could create together?

Send me an email and let's get this conversation going!
