I am currently a Lecturer in the Software Engineering department at [Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.buitms.edu.pk). 
I have a Masters (thesis) in Computer Science from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/)
https://www.fsu.edu/. At FSU, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Xiuwen Liu] (https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~liux/). I also served as a lecturer at [Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University](https://www.sbkwu.edu.pk/). I am also a digital artist.

My research interests include applied Machine and Deep Machine learning, Data Science, and hyperdimensional Computing. I believe to solve the crucial issues that our nation faces can be only addressed through the integration of insights, expertise and techniques from various research fields. I am a strong advocate of Women in STEM. My main source of leisure is Art. I have won several competitions in art including poster competition for WIE. My artwork [Am I human Enough]( https://hsf.fsu.edu/am-i-human-enough) received an Honorable mention in the Honors, scholars and fellows Visual Arts awards at Florida State University. I also enjoy gaming.

My goal as an educator is to provide students with tools to improve their lives, and the world. I try to teach as practically as possible. 

A major influence of my teaching philosophy is the Knowles' theory of andragogy. Adults need to know why they need to learn something, They need to learn experientially, approach learning as problem-solving, and they learn best when the topic is of immediate value. My biggest motivation as a teacher is to adequately prepare students for the next level, whether that is the next course in their program sequence, an internship, full time employment, or something else.
