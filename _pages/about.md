My name is Saniya Ashraf. I am currently an AI scientist at [Control Automotive and Robotics Lab](https://carl-buitems.github.io) at [Balochistan University of IT, Engineering and Management Sciences](https://www.buitms.edu.pk). Our current Research Focuses on developing various Robots and state-of-the-art RL and Deep Learning Techniques. 
I have a Masters (thesis) in Computer Science from [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/)
https://www.fsu.edu/. At FSU, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Xiuwen Liu] (https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~liux/). I also served as a lecturer at [Sardar Bahadur Khan Women University](https://www.sbkwu.edu.pk/)

My research interests are purely interdisciplinary. I believe to solve the crucial issues that our nation faces can be only addressed through the integration of insights, expertise and techniques from various research fields. I am a strong advocate of Women in STEM. 
I am a jack of all trades when it comes to hobbies. I love cooking, baking, reading, writing, knitting, sewing, embroidering, etc. But my main source of leisure is Art. I won several competitions in art including poster competition for WIE. My artwork [Am I human Enough]( https://hsf.fsu.edu/am-i-human-enough) received an Honorable mention in the Honors, scholars and fellows Visual Arts awards at Florida State University. I also enjoy gaming.

My goal as an educator is to provide students with tools to improve their lives, and the world. I try to teach as practically as possible. 

A major influence of my teaching philosophy is the Knowles' theory of andragogy. Specifically the assumptions that Adults need to know why they need to learn something, Adults need to learn experientially, Adults approach learning as problem-solving, and Adults learn best when the topic is of immediate value. My biggest motivation as a teacher is to adequately prepare students for the next level, whether that is the next course in their program sequence, an internship, full time employment, or something else.  I take active measures to keep students in my classes and in college. One way I do this is by sharing research about grit and growth mindset. Another way I seek to retain students is by sharing statistics about the benefits of a college degree and having them research careers and job requirements. Thinking about the finish line makes it easier to run the race. Above all, I aim to inspire.  I strive to develop communication skills and to foster a connection between myself and each student, connections between the students, and connections with industry. I treat students like fellow human beings. I am cognizant of their stress levels and try to help them learn stress management techniques. While learning, I want them to also have fun and find fulfillment in life. as one of my former professors said “It’s not the grades you make, it’s the hands you shake.”
